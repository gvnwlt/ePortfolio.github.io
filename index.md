## ePortfolio Introduction

My experience in the computer science curriculum and capstone has enhanced my current and future career contributions by gaining a deeper understanding of the fundamentals of computer science.  The computer science curriculum has provided me with the required competencies across a broad range of topics so that I can be a better asset in the field. This portfolio highlights the foundational work that I have produced. 

Collaborating with team environments has played a large part in various courses throughout the curriculum so far as receiving and providing feedback to fellow classmates on development projects. Using version control software, such as Git, to carryout code reviews and to perform operations on different development branches was a vital process, as working in the real-world of development utilizes collaboration in this form heavily. All of the projects that are presented in this portfolio are a result of that process in one way or another, meaning that each project was a result of utilizing collaboration or feedback to produce the best possible product outside of my own bias. Design approach methodologies such as Agile have played a large role in the development process as well, providing the necessary framework to rapidly stand up a project and continuously make progress towards the deliverable. 

The artifacts in this portfolio represent four of the main aspects of computer science in the industry: 
 - software engineering and design
 - data structures and algorithms
 - databases
 - security
    
Each of these projects incorporates all of these aspects (for the exception of databases), but some are more representative of a certain aspect than others. Security is included as a component of creating code that is safe in operation and encapsulated where needed. 

The takeaway from these projects is that the core components of computer science have been internalized to produce quality work in the field as a software engineer. I currently work as a software engineer (started half way through the curriculum in 2017) and have found these principles of computer science  to be the biggest part of having success in my career so far. Going forward, I plan on enhancing these skills further to be a better software engineer that can adapt to various technologies quickly and I also intend on using what I have learned in this degree and in my current career to contribute to my graduate studies later on.
